I have decided to keep this project strictly application-oriented, the idea is to choose a task and build the solution gradually, i.e. start with the simplest method to solve the problem and then improve the solution with more sophisticated techniques.

## 01. Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
I will be starting with a simple classification task from Kaggle Competition, [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## 03. NLP with Disaster Tweets
This NLP task is from the Kaggle Competition, [NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started). Here I will be exploring various methods to extract features from the text.
