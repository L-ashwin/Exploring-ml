## Initial Motivation
I recently read the book ['The Compound Effect'](https://g.co/kgs/d85R46), although simple the core idea of the book was quite powerful. -"Small, seemingly insignificant steps completed consistently over time will create a radical difference."
Around the same time, I came to know about Ken Jee's [66 days of data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXLnbdHMf8w) initiative, and decided to pursue the idea.  
I have decided to keep this project strictly application-oriented, the idea is to choose a task and build the solution gradually, i.e. start with the simplest method to solve the problem and then improve the solution with more sophisticated techniques.

## 01. Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
I will be starting with a simple classification task from Kaggle, [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
